# Twilio-Integration-with-FastAPI
A Python project integrating Harry Potter API, OpenWeather API, and OpenNotify API to construct and send custom SMS messages via Twilio. The Flask app provides a button to trigger the process: fetching data from the APIs, constructing a message, and sending it via SMS to a validated number. The app logs sent messages to a JSON or text file and flashes a success message using Jinja.
